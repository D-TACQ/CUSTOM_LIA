mv /mnt/packages.opt/99-custom_lia-*tgz /mnt/packages

Please note: custom sysconfig required.

# recommended: reset LIA every shot:
# the auto soft trigger command is usually present
acq1001_069> cat /mnt/local/rc.user
cp /usr/local/CARE/acq400_streamd.0.conf-soft_trigger /etc/sysconfig/
cp /usr/local/CARE/LIA/acq400_streamd.0.conf.lia /etc/sysconfig/

please review examples 
/usr/local/CARE/LIA/sysconfig
it may be enough to simply copy-over and reboot:
cp /usr/local/CARE/LIA/sysconfig/acq425-16-transient.init \
	/mnt/local/sysconfig/transient.init


** Tell EPICS we have LIA
acq1001_084> cat /mnt/local/sysconfig/epics.sh 
export EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES=500000
export IOC_PREINIT=./scripts/make-lia-aliases
# allow more than 80 "channels" per module eg for LIA
export ACQ400IOC_IDX_GT32=1


Control reference offset with
set.lia.ref_offset REF OFFSET
.. set offset value for REF
set.lia.ref_chan REF CHAN
.. set external reference channel for REF
set.lia.intref.freq REF FREQ
.. set intref frequency


Default intref uses internal clock 100MHz.
However, it's also possible to use an external clock to drive the internal
reference. This way the internal reference is frequency locked to some
external reference. The external clock signal on the front panel can
be set from 2MHz .. 10MHz. Then it's multiplied up by an onboard PLL to
give a high frequency waveform to clock the internal reference, resulting
in a high resolution reference signal.

Note that since the FPGA internal clock domain is 100MHz, and signals have to pass FROM the external clock domain to the internal
clock domain, it's recommended that the the clock going into the FPGA
is close to 100MHz. The PLL device is able to multiple any external 
signal from 2MHz to 10Mhz up to 100MHz

Run this sequence to configure. It can be embedded in /mnt/local/rc.user

Shortcut:

cat /usr/local/CARE/LIA/external-clock-intref-setup >>/mnt/local/rc.user

init_lia() {
(	/usr/local/epics/scripts/wait_ioc_ready;
	sleep 2;
	# hook the 2 MHz clock..
	set.site 0 SYS:CLK:FPMUX=FPCLK
	sleep 2
	load.lia.intref 0

	set.lia.remote_clock_source
	set.site 0 SIG:CLK_MB:SET 100000000
	set.lia.intref.freq 0 20000
) & }


init_lia 

# recommendation: refer to CLKTREE OPI to check that the clocks are 
# correctly configured.
